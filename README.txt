A1 - Responsive Personal Portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- I had previously built my personal website prior to taking this course, but in light of A1 I decided do incorporate additional features. I learned about HTML form elements, and instead of just sending a redirect to email when contact button is clicked, I use a form to take in inputs and send them as an email as get request using mailto.
- My portfolio also was not accessibility friendly and did not fully comply with WC3's guidelines so I spent some time cleaning up my codebase to make sure that it abided by these standards while keeping functionality and
- Some advanced features include the scroll wheel slider to view my current projects implemented with JS and learned how to dynamically update content based on user event triggers particularly mouse event listeners.
- My page is hosted under the domain name imjamesruiz.com and deployed on GitHub pages. 



The number of assignment points you believe you have completed
- Going through the rubric for resubmittion, I am advocating for 8/10 points. As I noted above I had completed my portfolio during the summer
and this was one of the first full stack projects I wanted to build when I started focusing on web development so when I began tweaking it 
to fit the scope of the assignment, the existing code I made when I was still learning was present throughout the site, and I made the 
and I made the design choice to just build on top of what I had already instead of starting over. So if the design principles aren't the best
please forgive me on that. 
- But I do have
    1. Correct ReadMe text file. 1/1
    2. Includes Basic HTML Content: 2/2
    3. Includes Basic CSS Styling: 2/2
    4. Includes an advanced feature; yes scrolling project cards controlled by js dom manipulation.
    5. Responsive layout: 
    - it is somewhat responsive but some of the components in my website may break on small screens 
    such as the navbar, skills container, and the main description section only. However, I understand media queries and the 
    importance of responsive design. 1/2;
    6. Passes 3 Validation Screenshots 2/2;
    7. Embracing the spirit of the assignment. 
    I think that I could have put more effort into the first submission, and I am fine with
    my original score of 1/2

8/10

A list containing the basic HTML content, CSS styling, and advanced feature you included in your portfolio
- Divided into sections -> about projects expereince, skills, with external icons that link to my social medias as well as my resume. Also 
displays contact form for user inquiries. 


Rationale for any accessibility errors you ignored
How long it took you to complete the assignment
- the first time I completed it a while because I was still learning and started from scratch. But I think editing it
 ~3 hours..

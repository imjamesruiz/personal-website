A1 - Responsive Personal Portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- I had previously built my personal website prior to taking this course, but in light of A1 I decided do incorporate additional features. I learned about HTML form elements, and instead of just sending a redirect to email when contact button is clicked, I use a form to take in inputs and send them as an email as get request using mailto.
- My portfolio also was not accessibility friendly and did not fully comply with WC3's guidelines so I spent some time cleaning up my codebase to make sure that it abided by these standards while keeping functionality and
- Some advanced features include the scroll wheel slider to view my current projects implemented with JS and learned how to dynamically update content based on user event triggers particularly mouse event listeners.
- My page is hosted under the domain name imjamesruiz.com and deployed on GitHub pages.
